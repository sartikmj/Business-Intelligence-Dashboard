Why do we need CORS?
By default, browsers block requests from one origin (like abc.com) trying to access data from another origin (like xyz.com).
This is done to protect users from malicious sites stealing their data.

✅ When do we use CORS?
When your frontend and backend are on different domains or ports, for example:

Frontend: http://localhost:3000

Backend: http://localhost:5000

You’ll need to enable CORS on the backend to allow the frontend to access data.

⚙ How to enable CORS in Express.js:
js
Copy code
const cors = require('cors');
app.use(cors());
🧠 Simple Summary:
🔸 Term	🔹 Meaning
CORS	Tells the browser: “It’s okay to allow this cross-site request.”
Why	Browsers block other domains for security
Use	Allow frontend and backend to talk if they’re on different origins

Let me know if you want a diagram or error example like “CORS policy: No ‘Access-Control-Allow-Origin’ header.”

Debugging issues

Monitoring request activity

Logging to files or console


🛠️ const app = express(); — What does it do?
This line creates an Express application instance that you’ll use to define routes, middleware, and server logic.


📦 app.use(express.json()); — What does it do?
It tells your Express app to automatically parse incoming JSON data from the request body.

✅ Why is it needed?
When a client sends JSON data (like in a POST or PUT request), this middleware:

Parses the JSON body

Adds it to req.body so you can easily access it in your routes

🔄 What are Middlewares in Express.js?
Middleware in Express is a function that has access to the request and response objects and can:

extended: true	Supports nested objects/arrays using the qs library


📦 const router = express.Router(); — What does it do?
It creates a mini Express application (called a router) that you can use to define routes separately and then attach to the main app.

✅ Why use express.Router()?
To organize your routes into different files/modules — especially useful in large applications.
🔸 Code	🔹 Purpose
express.Router()	Create modular route handlers
app.use('/path', router)	Mount those routes in main app
